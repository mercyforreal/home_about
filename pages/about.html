           <div><h2>Why Digital Skills?
        </h2></div> 
        <div>Traditional skills would soon go into extinction because there is always an uprise statistic of technology or technology based embracement into work of life. The world is moving fast, trends are unpredictably changing and no one can stop that.

            We are trying to bridge the gap between our human capacity and technology demands. We are helping in pursuing SDG goal 9 â€“ Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. This can only happen in a digital technology oriented environment; hence we need to equip people with technology skill to cover up the space and pace we have left behind in joining the advancing nation on board.
